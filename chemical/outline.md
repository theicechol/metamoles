Outline for Chemical recognition by Python

1. Method for chemical structure input based on SMILES string
2. Process to analyze important functional groups or reaction centers, based on RetroRules selection algorithm
3. Assign plausible transformation for that particular compound
4. Apply chemical structure expansion with conserved reaction centers
