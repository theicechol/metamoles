## Graphical Explanation of our Goal
![Expected_Output](https://github.com/theicechol/metamoles/blob/master/figures/Expected_RetroSynthesis_Output.png)

### Current Work

**UW-DIRECT Project on metabolite retrosynthetic analysis**
- Aim to utilize data science and software engineering intuition to find, and predict, a plausible metabolic pathway for production of a given molecule with retrosynthetic analysis approach. 
- Current focus is to find a novel promiscuous substrate for enzymatic transformation.

### Future Work
-	Add compounds with canonical SMILES string but no isomeric SMILES string
- Test inclusion of additional features, such as full chemical fingerprints and enzyme descriptors
-	Explore alternatives models such as SVMs, neural networks, decision trees/random forests, and ensemble methods
- Extend approach to include non-promiscuous enzymes
- Include simple chemical transformation for biocatalysis application
